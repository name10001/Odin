# To do

## Bugs/Testing
* Test genocide card end states, and check for ties
* Make testcases for each card. Ideally make the testcases if the implementation changes and don't bother until then.

## Lobby
* Make end game screen with stats, goes back to waiting room from here.
* Make more settings for each game. Allow you to customize the frequency of cards.
* Allow players to be kicked if they are logged out for > 1 min
* Add a time limit for how long you can spend picking cards (Add to waiting room options)

## UI and Animations
* Change the background
* Show thanos animations for other people?
* "Your turn" messages
* Capatilist animation
* Swap hand animation?
* Jesus Animation?

## Gameplay
* Add more cards
* More ideas for balancing the game later

## Cards ideas
* Snowden card -- animate message
* New colour variants of current cards (EG: fuckin' purple/white m8, barney card that lets you remove all purples, red/green/blue/yellow versions of +4, swap card)
* Spiny shell card? (from mario kart) - Gives 10 cards to person with lowest amount (Might be too similar to fuck you)
* Some cards that affect your/other people's ability to play cards (similar to dislexia, but could be simpler like "can't play black cards for 3 turns")
* Oof card - a worse version of the pawn card which literally causes you to pick up the pickup chain value when it's played (only way you can play it too)
* Card that forces someone to play one of the cards in your hand and continues the game from their turn
* Card that causes everyone else to only be able to play 1 card at a time for a limited amount of time. (Lightning?)
* Card that lets you play any card in your hand with it - maybe make it rainbow so it can go on anything
* Jigsaw puzzle - can only be played together with other fitting jigsaw puzzles.
* Radioactive card (orange) - every turn you have this card in your hand you gain an extra card
* Freeze card (white) - freezes a player for 2? turns such that they cannot make a move (skipped)
* Shield card - Blocks all effects from other players for 5 turns or so. Notes: Will block skip cards? Blocks communist too, cards are only shared amongst everyone else. Blocks any card swapping/giving. If you're the person with the most cards people shouldn't be able to play capitalist.
