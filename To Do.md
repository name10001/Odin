# To do

## Bugs/Testing
* Work out why the game freezes on some devices and forces a refresh
* Test on Safari?

## Lobby functionality
* Show game states in the waiting room once a game is over

#### Chat
* Spam prevention
* Limit number of chat messages in the front end
* Option to turn off

## UI Design
* Better background?
* Arrow to show direction of players turn's?
* Update player card amounts when doing card animations

## Gameplay
* Add some new cards in (some ideas below)
* Nerf/buff some cards
* Move some cards from making choices before to making choices after

#### Cards ideas
* Snowden card -- animate message
* New colour variants of current cards (EG: fuckin' purple/white m8, barney card that lets you remove all purples, red/green/blue/yellow versions of +4, swap card)
* Spiny shell card? (from mario kart) - Gives 10 cards to person with lowest amount (Might be too similar to fuck you)
* Some cards that affect your/other people's ability to play cards (similar to dislexia, but could be simpler like "can't play black cards for 3 turns")
* Oof card - a worse version of the pawn card which literally causes you to pick up the pickup chain value when it's played (only way you can play it too)
* Card that forces someone to play one of the cards in your hand and continues the game from their turn
* Card that causes everyone else to only be able to play 1 card at a time for a limited amount of time. (Lightning?)
* Jigsaw puzzle - can only be played together with other fitting jigsaw puzzles.
* Radioactive card (orange) - every turn you have this card in your hand you gain an extra card
* Shield card - Blocks all effects from other players for 5 turns or so. Notes: Will block skip cards? Blocks communist too, cards are only shared amongst everyone else. Blocks any card swapping/giving. If you're the person with the most cards people shouldn't be able to play capitalist.
